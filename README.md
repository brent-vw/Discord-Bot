# Use your own

If you don't like the commands or want to add any, all you have to do is edit the code and make a json file with following api keys called ".apikeys":

```json
{
  "token": "your discord bot token",
  "dev_token":"optional a discord bot dev token",
  "wolfram_token":"your wolfram alpha token",
  "league_token":"your league token for realtime game info",
  "open_league_token":"your champion.gg token for statistic info"
}
```

Then you can just run "main.py" and invite the bot to your server.
